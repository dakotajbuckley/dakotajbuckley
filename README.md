My name is Dakota. Iâ€™m a software engineer with a love for helping others. 

My passion for development started through a simple coding course in high school. That passion and love has turned into skills that I use everyday to solve real-world problems. 

Now, I create amazing solutions for people by building full-stack web applications, and I would love to work with you next!
